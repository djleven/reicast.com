September and October were busy as usual. We fixed some stuff and also added some new features.
We unfortunatly missed our goal to release 18.10 in October so we now try to get 18.11 out, so stay tuned for the next feature report.

Versioning [#1396](https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator/pull/1396)
---
We unified the display of the version for Android, Linux and Windows targets.
Using Android the version is displayed in the about dialog (see screenshot) using Windows and Linux there is the new command line switch ``-version``.
